# Automatic-KG-Construction

This is the code implementation for my bachelor's research thesis, Automatic Construction Knowledge Graph Construction for Fine-grained Image Classification. There are two notebooks, the first notebook is for the KG construction, and the second notebook is used to evaluate the KG in a zero-shot learning image classification task. There are two parts to the second notebook. The first part is used to create the knowledge graph embeddings, which is generated using Ampligraph [1]. The second part uses these knowledge graph embeddings in the Embarrassingly Simple Approach to Zero-shot Learning Model [2] and the implementation from https://github.com/chichilicious/embarrassingly-simple-zero-shot-learning. 

In this research, we used the Caltech-UCSD 200-2011 Bird DataSet (CUB). Additionally, we contributed a second dataset of bird descriptions that correspond to the classes in the CUB dataset. We also used two domain-specific ontologies, Uberon[3] and Pato[4]. 

The datasets can be downloaded from this link.
